* File Name: main_cm0p.c

* Version: 1.10
*
* Description: Demonstrates sharing of a region of SRAM memory between two
* CPUs.
*
* Note: The main.c files for both of the CPUs in the PSoC 6 are part of the
* same PSoC Creator project. They are both compiled at project build time.
* The resultant .hex file has the code for both CPUs. When the project
* executes, the code in main_cm0p.c starts executing first. The Cortex-M0+
* code then turns on the Cortex-M4 CPU, and the code in main_cm4.c starts
* executing.
