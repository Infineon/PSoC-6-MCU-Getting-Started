# Introduction
This repository contains examples and demos for PSoC 6 MCU family of devices, a single chip solution for the emerging IoT devices. PSoC 6 MCU bridges the gap between expensive, power hungry application processors and low‑performance microcontrollers (MCUs). The ultra‑low‑power, dual-core architecture of PSoC 6 MCU offers the processing performance needed by IoT devices, eliminating the tradeoffs between power and performance.

Cypress provides a wealth of data at [www.cypress.com](http://www.cypress.com/) to help you select the right PSoC device and effectively integrate it into your design. Visit our [PSoC 6 MCU](http://www.cypress.com/products/32-bit-arm-cortex-m4-psoc-6) webpage to explore more about PSoC 6 MCU family of device.
Feel free to explore through the code example source files and let us innovate together!

# Navigating the Repository

## Code Example List
#### 1. CE221773 - PSoC 6 MCU - Hello World Example
This code example demonstrates the implementation of simple UART communication and LED control using PSoC 6 MCU. The UART and LED control tasks are executed by the Arm Cortex-M4 CPU of PSoC 6 MCU.
#### 2. CE220263 - PSoC 6 MCU GPIO Pins Example
This example demonstrates multiple methods of configuring, reading, writing, and generating interrupts with PSoC 6 General
Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pins. Both the PSoC Creator schematic Pins Component and PDL GPIO driver methods are
shown.
#### 3. CE216795 - PSoC 6 MCU Dual-Core Basics
These examples demonstrate the two CPU cores in PSoC 6 MCU doing separate independent tasks, and communicating with
each other using shared memory and the inter-processor communication (IPC) block.

PSoC 6 bridges the gap between expensive, power hungry application processors and low‑performance microcontrollers (MCUs). The ultra‑low‑power PSoC 6 MCU architecture offers the processing performance needed by IoT devices, eliminating the tradeoffs between power and performance. The PSoC 6 MCU contains a dual‑core architecture, with both cores on a single chip. It has an Arm® Cortex®‑M4 for high‑performance tasks, and an Arm® Cortex®‑M0+ for low-power tasks, and with security built-in, your IoT system is protected.
